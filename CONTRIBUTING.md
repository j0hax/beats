# Contributing

Constructive contributions are always welcome!

This file serves as a rough guideline for most projects. Please note that it may change at any time or be adapted to suit a specific project.

## Commit Messages

Keep these points in mind:

1. Explain your changes briefly, yet precisely
2. Capitalize the subject line
3. Use the imperative mood for the subject line
4. Keep one commit per change, even if it changes multiple features or files

## Coding Style

For most supported languages, the [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) utility with the `--style=google` option is preferred.
